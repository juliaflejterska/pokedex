POKEDEX is an <b> interactive React catalogue of pokemon </b> with <b> data fetched from ‘Pokémon API’</b>  (https://pokeapi.com).

---

✨ Initially, a <b> list of 20 pokemon </b> is displayed on the screen. Of course you can <b> load more </b> of them - there is a special button for that.

✨ When you hover your mouse over one of the cards, you can see basic information about the selected creature: its name and type. When you click on it, its weight and height also appear.

✨ Moreover, POKEDEX APP allows you to <b> sort the displayed pokemon by their type. </b> You can also <b> search for any pokemon that is available </b> in ‘Pokémon API’ by entering its name in the special field provided for this.

✨ By clicking on the moon icon, you can <b> change the mode from light to dark and vice versa. </b>

The animations and transitions used are from the Framer Motion library.
